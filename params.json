VESC handels the message like a message needed for the nunchuk app. For deltails to the nunchuk app on the vesc please refer to:\r\n\r\nhttp://vedder.se/2015/01/vesc-open-source-esc/\r\n\r\nThe firmware of the VESC must be adapted, so that the UART message can be handled. Pull request is following soon. So far use please my fork:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RollingGecko/bldc.git\r\n\r\n#Specification\r\n* Remote to VESC over nRF24 Radio\r\n* Reading of X/Y joystick positions and 2 buttons and transmit to vesc\r\n* Vesc is connected over UART to remote Ardunio nano\r\n* All measured values from VESC like input voltage, current etc. is send to remote\r\n* TX is master and RX slave: Sending direction  nRF24 from TX to RX. Feedback only over acknowledgement message\r\n\r\n#Feature List\r\n* \r\n\r\n#ToDo\r\n* Acceleration with pressed PID doesnÂ´ t work. Also reverse. Problem must be on VESC site\r\n* Remaining Capacity of battery on VESC site not implemented\r\n* Vibration alarm at defined rest capacity state (in defined time intervalls)\r\n* Displaying traveled km over 4 RGB LED \r\n\r\n#Wish list\r\nComing soon.\r\n\r\n#Implementation Example \r\n\r\n\r\nBased on a Nunchuk and a Arduino nano. Beside that 4 2812 LED for state indication and alert vibrator are implemented. Joystick and buttons are from the original nunchuck.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RollingGecko/ArduBoardControler/gh-pages/images/Pictures/ReadyTX.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RollingGecko/ArduBoardControler/gh-pages/images/Pictures/TXinside1.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RollingGecko/ArduBoardControler/gh-pages/images/Pictures/TXinside.jpg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
